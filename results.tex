Dasgupta et al. \cite{dasgupta2012social} performed various experiments to compare the performance of the presented samplers.
They focused on two large, publicly available databases \texttt{LiveJournal} and \texttt{DBLP}.

The \texttt{LiveJournal} network contains 5.36M nodes and approximately 160M edges and is based on a snapshot of the social network \url{http://livejournal.com} in March 2008.
The \texttt{DBLP} network contains 368K nodes and 8M edges and consists of the content of the DBLP database located at \url{http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/}.
