\subsection{Setup}
Dasgupta et al. \cite{dasgupta2012social} performed various experiments to compare the performance of the presented samplers.
They focused on two large, publicly available databases \texttt{LiveJournal} and \texttt{DBLP}.

The \texttt{LiveJournal} network contains 5.36M nodes and approximately 160M edges and is based on a snapshot of the social network \url{http://livejournal.com} in March 2008. In addition to the network they extracted the users age, location (city, state, country) and a list of interests where available on the users public profile.
The \texttt{DBLP} network contains 368K nodes and 8M edges and consists of the content of the DBLP database located at \url{http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/}. The nodes stand for authors while the edges represent co-authorship on some publication. The node attributes are formed by the authors publication venues, however only the 100 most popular venues were considered. 

Since the samplers have been designed keeping the Definition \ref{defsampler} in mind, recall that they provide an additive $\epsilon$-approximation. So most importantly we measure the absolute error of each sampler with respect to the true value. If our estimator outputs $\hat{f}$ approximating $\bar{f}$ we measure the error as $|\bar{f}-\hat{f}|$.

To get a relation between error and sample size we vary the sample size $r$ from a minimum of $r = 100$ to $r = 50000$. We use the distributions mentioned in chapter \ref{algorithms}: uniform at random (\texttt{unif}), proportional to the degree of the node (\texttt{deg}) and additionally, proportional to the square root of the degree of the node (\texttt{sqrtdeg}).
