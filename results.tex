Dasgupta et al. \cite{dasgupta2012social} performed various experiments to measure the performance of the samplers.
They focused on two large, publically available databases.

The \texttt{LiveJournal} network contains 5.36M nodes and approximately 160M edges and is based on a snapshot of the social network livejournal.com in March 2008.
The \texttt{DBLP} network contains 368K nodes and 8M edges and consists of the content of the DBLP database located on http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/.
