This report provides the reader with an overview of the concept of \textit{social sampling}.
Social sampling is a class of methods where informants in a poll answer with a summary of their friends cumulative responses. The main interest lies in the correlation between the sampling size and the sampling error and the systematic bias due to the network structure.

I define the concept of a sampler and present a \texttt{Naive} as well as an \texttt{Ideal} sampling algorithm. Further I show and prove some of their most important properties regarding sample size and bias.

Eventually I present more realistic and efficient estimators and their real-world performance and demonstrate that social sampling is a powerful tool to obtain accurate estimates with very few samples.
