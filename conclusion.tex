In this report I introduced the reader to the concept of a sampler and analyzed if polling a social network can result in less samples being needed.
I presented various different sampling algorithms including bounds on their sample size to guarantee a certain error.
The measurements showed that when executed correctly, meaning choosing an appropriate algorithm, consider a significant knowledge of the underlying network graph, results in considerably less samples needed compared to a naive sampling approach.
